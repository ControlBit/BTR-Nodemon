# TODO

- [x] Initial commit, with basic of nodemon readme
- [x] Decide upon a project to build (to show functionality beyond clonemon)
- [ ] Create GIST for final project
- [x] Poll developers for the way they use nodemon
- [x] Should clonemon use fork instead of spawn (to more closely match nodemon)?
- [ ] Add content to OUTLINE, delete NOTES and TO_COVER
- [ ] README should be the public-facing guide
- [ ] Set up nodemondule as a wrapper for a crashing server - use requireable nodemon as a way to increase your application uptime
