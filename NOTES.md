What do I want to cover?

How is nodemon typically used?

Where do you setup a global nodemon config file?

Should I build a very basic version of nodemon to demonstrate what is happening, to provide a clearer understanding and appreciation of nodemon?

What project do I want to build?

Would nodemon as a module be good for a production application, since you can write a wrapper that restarts your server when it crashes?
